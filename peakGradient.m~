% Finds an estimate for the gradient of the firing rate after its peak 
% following threshold. 

% Threshold is defined as the point for which the firing rate maintains above
% the resting firing rate for more than 10% of the trial duration. 

% Each peak is identified by having the largest prominence of peaks 
% returned by the Matlab findpeaks function*. Peaks for which lie within 
% the last 10% of the trial duration are disregarded. This ensures there is
% sufficient data to characterise between rise, fall and plateau
% repsponses.

% * see here for more information on prominence.
